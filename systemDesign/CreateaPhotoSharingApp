More specifically, the system allows people to follow each other, share/comment/like pictures, and maybe some other features like explore, advertisement 


High-level solution

user object and picture object.
relational database
a user table which contains information like name, email, registration date and so on
two relations – user follow relation and user-picture relation


1. Response time
one costly operation is to render users feed
The server has to go over everyone the user follows, fetch all the pictures from them, and rank them based on particular algorithms

read the top N most recent pictures
offline pipelines to precompute some signals that can speed up the ranking.


Scale architecture
divide the whole system into small components
database separate from web apps --- different computers

scale the database. For this specific problem, we can either do the vertical splitting (partitioning) by splitting the database into sub-databases like user database, comment database etc. or horizontal splitting (sharding) by splitting based on attributes like US users, European users
a separate system for image storage has a lot of advantages. For instance, cache and replication can be much simpler when files are static.


Image optimization: to save space, images should be compressed


Feed ranking
rank everything in chronological order
an algorithm that combines time and how likely the user will like this picture is definitely promising.
features that matter a lot include like/comment numbers, whether the user has liked many photos of the owner and so on
