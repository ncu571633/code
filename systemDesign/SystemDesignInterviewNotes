Scale from zero to millions of users

1. Single server setup
User  DNS
1 server(web app, database, cache)

2. Database

User  DNS
1 server(web app, cache)
database server:
Which database to use:
  relational database: SQL
  nonrelational database: unstructured data, low latency, store large data

Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling
  vertical scaling: add more powers(CPU, RAM)
  horizontal scaling: more servers

Cache:
1. When to use cache: read frequently, not modified infrequently
2. Expiration policy
3. Consistency

Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system: cache data from db.

Asynchronous processing: user doesn't need to wait the job to finish, and continue to do the next task.
   for example: upload video/photo
   message queue: kafka
