Given three sorted arrays A[], B[] and C[], find 3 elements i, j and k from A, B and C respectively such that max(abs(A[i] – B[j]), abs(B[j] – C[k]), abs(C[k] – A[i])) is minimized. Here abs() indicates absolute value.

Example :

Input: A[] = {1, 4, 10}
       B[] = {2, 15, 20}
       C[] = {10, 12}
Output: 10 15 10
10 from A, 15 from B and 10 from C

Input: A[] = {20, 24, 100}
       B[] = {2, 19, 22, 79, 800}
       C[] = {10, 12, 23, 24, 119}
Output: 24 22 23
24 from A, 22 from B and 23 from C

Note that we increment the pointer of the array which has the minimum, because our goal is to decrease the difference. Increasing the maximum pointer increases the difference. Increase the second maximum pointer can potentially increase the difference.


void findClosest(int A[], int B[], int C[], int p, int q, int r)
{
 
    int diff = INT_MAX;  // Initialize min diff
 
    // Initialize result
    int res_i =0, res_j = 0, res_k = 0;
 
    // Traverse arrays
    int i=0,j=0,k=0;
    while (i < p && j < q && k < r)
    {
        // Find minimum and maximum of current three elements
        int minimum = min(A[i], min(B[j], C[k]));
        int maximum = max(A[i], max(B[j], C[k]));
 
        // Update result if current diff is less than the min
        // diff so far
        if (maximum-minimum < diff)
        {
             res_i = i, res_j = j, res_k = k;
             diff = maximum - minimum;
        }
 
        // We can't get less than 0 as values are absolute
        if (diff == 0) break;
 
        // Increment index of array with smallest value
        if (A[i] == minimum) i++;
        else if (B[j] == minimum) j++;
        else k++;
    }
 
    // Print result
    cout << A[res_i] << " " << B[res_j] << " " << C[res_k];
}
