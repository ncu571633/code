Moving Average
1. A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past.
2. An exponential moving average (EMA) is a weighted average that gives greater importance to the price of a stock in more recent days, 
making it an indicator that is more responsive to new information.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) 收敛与发散
3 parts:
1. MACD: calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). 
2. 信号线，即MACD的9天均线。
3. MACD 直方图，它是 MACD 线和信号线之间的差异。
Usage:
当 MACD 线从信号线的下方向上方交叉时，就会识别出看涨信号。
当 MACD 线从信号线的上方穿过到下方时，就会识别出看跌信号。
