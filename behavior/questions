Conflict

Story
My manager asked me to work together with one co-worker. However, I had a conflict with him over the choice of design for a project.
We both had strong opinions and valid arguments, but we could not agree on which one was better. 
So I decided to have a meeting with him and explain why I preferred my option, but also listen to his reasoning.  (Communicate directly and respectfully with the co-worker)
First we make sure we have same assumption/goal/requirement, then to see in which part we agree with each other, and also find out the difference of our approach. 
Then we had a meeting with manager and the team, to vote the best solution. 

Identify the source and impact of the conflict
Listen to their perspective and acknowledge their feelings
Express your own needs and expectations
Seek a mutually beneficial solution or compromise
Involve your manager or a third party if needed
Follow up and monitor the progress
