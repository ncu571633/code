Here are some examples of how to answer conflict interview questions for software engineers4:

“I had a conflict with a co-worker over the choice of a framework for a project. We both had strong opinions and valid arguments, but we could not agree on which one was better. I decided to initiate a conversation with him and explain why I preferred my option, but also listen to his reasoning. We realized that we had different assumptions and goals, and that we needed to align them first. We agreed to do some research and testing on both frameworks, and present our findings to the team. The team then voted on the best option, and we both respected the decision.”
