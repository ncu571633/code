Communication: also ask for help if blocked
  “I was working on a project where I was tasked with creating a new feature for our service. 
  I was given a deadline of two weeks to complete the project. 
  However, I underestimated the amount of time it would take me to complete the project and ended up missing the deadline by a week. 
The reason is that there are extern APIs not well documented, and it is hard to port into our system. 
  I learned that 
1. it’s important to set realistic expectations. 
Don't overcommit a task, and learn to push back reasonably. 
For example, list the sub items one by one, and then we can see how much time could take for each subitem. 
2. Communicate any issues or delays with my team members. 
3. Always prepare in the plan meeting. Do some investigation, so I can give an time estimation. 

Moving forward, I made sure to communicate any issues or delays with my team members and set realistic expectations for myself.”



frustration
For the technolical side. it is straight forward. 

One thing that can frustrate me at work is when there is a lack of clear communication, 
especially regarding project requirements or priorities. 
For example, if requirements change frequently without proper documentation or notice, 
it can lead to wasted effort or rework, which is discouraging for the team.

However, I’ve learned to handle this frustration properly. 
When I notice there is a gap between communication, I try to clarify expectations early—asking questions, documenting decisions, 
and confirming priorities with stakeholders. 
I also encourage regular check-ins or stand-ups to keep everyone aligned. 
This approach helps minimize misunderstandings and keeps the team moving forward efficiently.

Ultimately, while unclear communication can be frustrating, I see it as an opportunity to improve collaboration 
and contribute to a better team process.


f)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then you failed

Communicate any ideas or changes with my manager and team members before implementing them
Story:
  I was working on a project where I was tasked to improve the software performance. 
  I had an idea that I thought would be great for the feature and decided to implement it without approval from my manager. 
  However, the feature didn’t work as expected and ended up causing issues. 
  I learned that it’s important to communicate any ideas or changes with my manager and team members before implementing them. 
it can lead to wasted effort or rework, which is discouraging for the team.

g)        Tell me a goal you didn't achieve
Situation: I was working on a project that required me to learn a new programming language.
Task: My goal was to become proficient in the language within two weeks.
Action: I spent several hours each day studying and practicing the language.
Result: Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to become proficient in the language within two weeks. 
However, I did make significant progress and was able to complete the project on time by working with other members of the team who were more experienced in the language.


Learning a new programming language or framework
Getting a promotion or a raise
Completing a project on time and within budget
Improving the quality or performance of their code


3.        Success
a)        Tell me a time when you succeed / a project you proud of
b)        Tell me a time when you exceed the expectation
c)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then succeed
I don’t believe in taking unnecessary risks, however when the pros and cons have been properly identified I am happy to make a calculated risk because I believe it will be beneficial overall. 
There was a time 
I took a risk at work was when I suggested a new approach to a project that I was working on. Basically by using C++ 14 new standard to write code. 
The pro is I can learn new stuff, and the performance of C++ new standard is better than the old ones. (runs faster, also there are more libraries I can use so I don't need to write one myself).
The con is I am not familiar with the new standard and there is a learning curve. 
After I compared the pros and cons, I understand taking this calculated risks can lead to great results. 
So I took the result and finally I finished the project successfully. 

d)        Tell me a goal you achieved

4.        Conflict
a)        Tell me a time when you resolved a conflict on your team
b)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your manager
c)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your team / peer
d)        Tell me a time when you provided suggestion but had not been considered, what was the impact of it
e)        Tell me a time when you had to go behind your manager's back to do something

My manager asked me to work together with one co-worker. However, I had a conflict with him over the choice of design for a project.
We both had strong opinions and valid arguments, but we could not agree on which one was better. 
So I decided to have a meeting with him and explain why I preferred my option, but also listen to his reasoning.  (Communicate directly and respectfully with the co-worker)
First we make sure we have same assumption/goal/requirement, then to see in which part we agree with each other, and also find out the difference of our approach. 
Then we both understood each other's suggestions and presented our ideas to the rest of the team, which allowed everyone to voice their opinions. 
We were able to come to a mutual decision as a group. 

Situation:
In a previous role, I was working on a critical feature that was scheduled for release. 
During final testing, I discovered a significant bug that could have impacted user experience and the product’s reputation. 
At the time, my manager was out of the office, and I knew that delaying the release was necessary to ensure quality.

Task:
My responsibility was to ensure the product was stable and reliable before release. 
Since my manager was unavailable, I needed to decide how to handle the situation to prevent potential issues from reaching our users.

Action:
I took the initiative to escalate the issue to the senior QA lead and the product owner, 
explaining the severity of the bug and recommending a delay. I also worked extra hours to help fix the bug and prepare a patch. 
Once my manager returned, I briefed them on the situation and the steps I took to address it, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Result:
Because of these actions, we were able to fix the bug before release, avoiding negative user impact. 
My manager appreciated my proactive approach and commitment to quality. 
This experience reinforced the importance of taking responsibility and acting in the best interest of the product, 
even when it means making decisions without direct approval.

b)        Tell me a time when you were forced to do something you are not familiar with
c)        Tell me a time when you worked under pressure / managed numerous responsibilities / had to multitask
d)        Tell me a time when you overcame an obstacle and delivered the result
e)        Tell me a time when you overcame a challenge
f)        Tell me a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision

Situation:
In my previous role as a software engineer, I was assigned to a project that required integrating a new third-party API.
At that time, I had limited experience with this specific API and the documentation is limited.

Task:
My task was to implement the integration quickly to meet a tight project deadline, despite i am not familiar with the API.

Action:
To tackle this challenge, I first spent time to thoroughly review the API documentation and explore sample code. 
I also reached out to the API provider’s support team for clarifications on specific issues. 
Additionally, I collaborated with a more experienced colleague who had worked on similar integrations. 
I broke down the task into smaller, manageable steps and tested each component thoroughly before moving forward.

Result:
Although I was initially unfamiliar with the API, my proactive approach allowed me to learn quickly and successfully 
complete the integration on time. The implementation worked seamlessly, 
and the project was delivered without delays. 
This experience taught me the importance of resourcefulness, seeking help when needed,
and embracing new challenges as opportunities to grow.

Situation
Last year, I was working on a team responsible for developing a new feature for our company’s flagship product. 
We were on a tight deadline, and the feature was highly anticipated by our clients.

Task
During development, I noticed a potential performance bottleneck in the way our API was handling large data requests. 
My task was to ensure the feature was delivered on time, but I realized that if we ignored this issue, it could lead to major problems after release.
Action

Instead of keeping quiet to avoid delays, I brought the issue to my team during our daily stand-up. 
I explained the potential risks and suggested a solution that involved refactoring part of the codebase. 
I volunteered to take on the extra work and collaborated closely with QA to make sure the fix wouldn’t introduce new bugs. 
I also kept stakeholders updated on our progress and any changes to the timeline.

Result
Although it required a short extension to our deadline, the team and stakeholders appreciated my transparency and proactive approach. 
The feature launched smoothly, with no performance issues reported by clients. Afterward, my team lead praised my integrity and problem-solving skills, 
and my teammates began to consult me more often for technical advice. 
This experience helped me build strong trust within my team and with our stakeholders.

g)        Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.

Situation
Last year, I was working on a project developing a new feature. 
One of our team members, who was responsible for a key module, consistently missed deadlines and delivered code with frequent bugs, 
which started to impact our overall progress.

Task
As the project’s lead developer, it was my responsibility to ensure the team stayed on track and delivered a high-quality product.
I needed to address this performance issue without demotivating the team member or disrupting team morale.

Action
I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with the team member to discuss my observations. 
I approached the conversation with empathy, asking if there were any challenges they were facing and how I could help. 
It turned out they were struggling with some of the newer technologies we were using and felt uncomfortable asking for help. 
I offered to pair-program with them on some tasks and encouraged them to attend our internal training sessions. 
I also set up regular check-ins to provide guidance and feedback.

Result
Over the next few weeks, their performance improved significantly. 
Their code quality increased, and they started meeting their deadlines. 
The team’s overall productivity improved, and the project was delivered on time. 
The team member later thanked me for the support, and we maintained a positive working relationship. 
This experience reinforced the importance of open communication and providing support to help teammates succeed.


h)        Tell me about a time when you had to convince your team on some design decision.
Situation

Last year, my team was tasked with building a new microservices-based backend for our company’s flagship product. During the design phase, there was a debate about whether to use synchronous REST APIs or adopt an asynchronous message queue for inter-service communication.
Task

As a senior engineer, I believed that using an asynchronous message queue would make our system more resilient and scalable. However, most of the team was more comfortable with REST APIs and was concerned about the learning curve and potential complexity.
Action

To address their concerns, I prepared a detailed comparison document outlining the pros and cons of both approaches, including scalability, fault tolerance, and maintenance. I also created a small prototype demonstrating how message queues could handle service failures gracefully. I presented my findings in a team meeting, encouraged open discussion, and answered everyone’s questions. I made sure to listen to their concerns and addressed them with practical examples and data from our prototype.
Result

After the discussion and seeing the prototype in action, the team agreed to move forward with the message queue approach. The decision paid off—our system handled unexpected traffic spikes smoothly and was easier to maintain than anticipated. My willingness to listen, provide evidence, and collaborate helped the team feel confident in the decision, and we successfully delivered a robust backend system.

How to convince others that we are right
1.  Question yourself first

10.        Deadline / Efficiency
a)        Tell me a time when you missed a deadline
b)        Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tight deadline but deliver in time
c)        Tell me a time when you provided a simple solution to a complex problem
d)        Tell me a time you had to be very strategic in multitasks and meet all your top priorities.
I had to do multitask when I was working as a senior software engineer for ABC company. 
I had to design and develop a new feature for software, fix some bugs reported by users, and mentor a junior developer on our team. 
To do this, I used a Kanban board to organize and prioritize my tasks. I also communicated with my manager and team members regularly to update them on my progress and ask for feedback. 
I was able to finish all the tasks on time and with high quality. The new feature increased performance by 85%, the bugs were resolved with minimal impact, 
and the junior developer improved his skills and confidence.

e)        Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

There are many possible reasons why a software engineer might fail to meet a project deadline, such as 
unclear requirements, 
unrealistic expectations, 
team dependencies, 
scope creep, 
or unforeseen challenges. 

Story: 
One example of such a situation is when an new graduate was asked to finish a complex project in two weeks, 
and that required more time and skills than he had. He realized he couldn’t finish the project on time and ask for help.

Action:
The problem is there is no enough communication. We have daily stand up meeting, but he didn't ask for help if he is blocked. 

So I discussed with him for several topics.
1. Can we change the scope? Doing less while delivering the same results? 
We decided to make the functionality to work first, then if we have time we can optimize. 
2. Do we need more people, maybe someone with better context on that feature that could be more productive.
I spend several hour to help him design the work flow. 

After these actions, we finished the project on time. 

Also after this, we did a postmortem on this. 
Analyze why are late. 
Did we provide a bad estimate? Why?
Did we find some part of the code base that was harder to change?
Did we introduce breaking changes/ introduced a bug that were not expected?

11.        Frugality
a)        Tell me about a time where you thought of a new way to save money for the company.
b)        Describe a time when you had to manage a budget (or manage time/money/resources/etc.). Were you able to get more out of less?
c)        Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time and resources / no resource.

how to negotiate and alloc more resources from the team
Situation:
In my previous role as a software engineer, our team was assigned a high-priority project with a tight deadline. 
However, we dont have enough people due to overlapping commitments with another ongoing project, 
and it became clear that our current resources would not be sufficient to deliver on time

Task:
As the lead developer, I was responsible for ensuring the project stayed on track.
My goal was to secure additional resources-specifically, to meet our delivery commitments without compromising quality.

Action:
I started by analyzing our current workload and identifying the specific bottlenecks that were slowing us down. 
I gathered data on our estimation and projected timelines, 
which showed we would likely miss our deadline by two weeks without intervention. 
I then prepared a concise proposal outlining these findings, the risks involved, and the potential business impact of a delay. 
I scheduled a meeting with my manager and the resource manager, presented the data,
and suggested reallocating one engineer from a lower-priority project and temporarily increasing our cloud testing resources. 
To facilitate a smooth transition, 
I offered to onboard the new team member myself and adjust our sprint planning to maximize their impact from day one

Result:
Management approved the reallocation and we got one extra engineer. 
With the extra support, we not only met our deadline but also improved our code coverage by 30%. 
The project’s success led to a new process for reviewing resource allocation at the start of each major project,
