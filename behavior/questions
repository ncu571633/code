can you give me an example for the interview behavior question: as a software engineer, tell me a time when you didn't meet the expectation


Senior Software Engineers are technical leaders and problem solvers who design, implement, test, rollout, and manage software services. 
They turn business requirements into simple, elegant, and optimal solutions at large scale, understand long-term visions, evangelize best practices across the team, 
participate and lead team discussions about architectural design, and ship code to millions of users around the world.

Software Engineers (SWE) work as part of a development team to implement solutions on impactful projects. 





1.        Basics
a)        Tell me about yourself
b)        Why this company
c)        Why this position / this team
d)        Why leave your last position
e)        Walk me through your typical day at work.
I like to start each day by going over my schedule to make sure any calls or meetings I have are top of mind and I get any prep work for those done first thing. 
Also try to brain storm the software design work and try to answer my emails when I am stil fresh. 
After that I write code, make code reviews, and Attend meetings with project managers, UI or UX designers, data scientists, and other team members.

2.        Failure
a)        Tell me a time when you failed on something
b)        Tell me a time when you made a mistake
c)        Tell me a time when you received a negative feedback
d)        Tell me a time when you showed resilience
e)        Tell me a time when you didn't meet the expectation
“I was working on a project where I was tasked with creating a new feature for our company’s website. 
I was given a deadline of two weeks to complete the project. 
However, I underestimated the amount of time it would take me to complete the project and ended up missing the deadline by a week. 
I learned that it’s important to set realistic expectations and communicate any issues or delays with my team members. 
Moving forward, I made sure to communicate any issues or delays with my team members and set realistic expectations for myself.”

f)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then you failed
g)        Tell me a goal you didn't achieve
Learning a new programming language or framework
Getting a promotion or a raise12
Completing a project on time and within budget1
Improving the quality or performance of their code


3.        Success
a)        Tell me a time when you succeed / a project you proud of
b)        Tell me a time when you exceed the expectation
c)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then succeed
I don’t believe in taking unnecessary risks, however when the pros and cons have been properly identified I am happy to make a calculated risk because I believe it will be beneficial overall. 
There was a time 
I took a risk at work was when I suggested a new approach to a project that I was working on. Basically by using C++ 14 new standard to write code. 
The pro is I can learn new stuff, and the performance of C++ new standard is better than the old ones. (runs faster, also there are more libraries I can use so I don't need to write one myself).
The con is I am not familiar with the new standard and there is a learning curve. 
After I compared the pros and cons, I understand taking this calculated risks can lead to great results. 
So I took the result and finally I finished the project successfully. 

d)        Tell me a goal you achieved

4.        Conflict
a)        Tell me a time when you resolved a conflict on your team
b)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your manager
c)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your team / peer
d)        Tell me a time when you provided suggestion but had not been considered, what was the impact of it
e)        Tell me a time when you had to go behind your manager's back to do something

My manager asked me to work together with one co-worker. However, I had a conflict with him over the choice of design for a project.
We both had strong opinions and valid arguments, but we could not agree on which one was better. 
So I decided to have a meeting with him and explain why I preferred my option, but also listen to his reasoning.  (Communicate directly and respectfully with the co-worker)
First we make sure we have same assumption/goal/requirement, then to see in which part we agree with each other, and also find out the difference of our approach. 
Then we both understood each other's suggestions and presented our ideas to the rest of the team, which allowed everyone to voice their opinions. 
We were able to come to a mutual decision as a group. 

Identify the source and impact of the conflict
Listen to their perspective and acknowledge their feelings
Express your own needs and expectations
Seek a mutually beneficial solution or compromise
Involve your manager or a third party if needed
Follow up and monitor the progress

b)        Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tight deadline but deliver in time
c)        Tell me a time when you provided a simple solution to a complex problem
d)        Tell me a time you had to be very strategic in multitasks and meet all your top priorities.
I had to do multitask when I was working as a senior software engineer for ABC company. 
I had to design and develop a new feature for software, fix some bugs reported by users, and mentor a junior developer on our team. 
To do this, I used a Kanban board to organize and prioritize my tasks. I also communicated with my manager and team members regularly to update them on my progress and ask for feedback. 
I was able to finish all the tasks on time and with high quality. The new feature increased performance by 85%, the bugs were resolved with minimal impact, 
and the junior developer improved his skills and confidence.

e)        Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

There are many possible reasons why a software engineer might fail to meet a project deadline, such as 
unclear requirements, 
unrealistic expectations, 
team dependencies, 
scope creep, 
or unforeseen challenges. 

Story: 
One example of such a situation is when an new graduate was asked to finish a complex project in two weeks, 
and that required more time and skills than he had. He realized he couldn’t finish the project on time and ask for help.

Action:
The problem is there is no enough communication. We have daily stand up meeting, but he didn't ask for help if he is blocked. 

So I discussed with him for several topics.
1. Can we change the scope? Doing less while delivering the same results? 
We decided to make the functionality to work first, then if we have time we can optimize. 
2. Do we need more people, maybe someone with better context on that feature that could be more productive.
I spend several hour to help him design the work flow. 

After these actions, we finished the project on time. 

Also after this, we did a postmortem on this. 
Analyze why are late. 
Did we provide a bad estimate? Why?
Did we find some part of the code base that was harder to change?
Did we introduce breaking changes/ introduced a bug that were not expected?

11.        Frugality
a)        Tell me about a time where you thought of a new way to save money for the company.
b)        Describe a time when you had to manage a budget (or manage time/money/resources/etc.). Were you able to get more out of less?
c)        Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time and resources / no resource.

12.        Common Follow-ups
a)        What’s your role in this project
b)        What’s your impact in this project
c)        What were the challenges and how you made sure that you finished it perfectly
d)        What did your manager / peer say, how did they like it
